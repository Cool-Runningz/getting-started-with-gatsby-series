        It‚Äôs like a language. You learn the alphabet, which are the scales. You
        learn sentences, which are the chords. And then you talk
        extemporaneously with the horn. It‚Äôs a wonderful thing to speak
        extemporaneously, which is something I‚Äôve never gotten the hang of. But
        musically I love to talk just off the top of my head. And that‚Äôs what
        jazz music is all about. I played in rhumba bands, mickey mouse bands;
        all kinds of bands. Records used to be documents, but now record
        companies want product. The saxophone is actually a translation of the
        human voice, in my conception. All you can do is play melody. No matter
        how complicated it gets, it‚Äôs still a melody. Life is too full of
        distractions nowadays. When I was a kid we had a little Emerson radio
        and that was it. We were more dedicated. We didn‚Äôt have a choice. There
        are four qualities essential to a great jazzman. They are taste,
        courage, individuality, and irreverence. These are the qualities I want
        to retain in my music
